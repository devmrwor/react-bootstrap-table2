# react-bootstrap-table2
Rebuilt [react-bootstrap-table](https://github.com/AllenFang/react-bootstrap-table)

## The problems/features I want to solve
* Performance
* Fully compatiable with bootstrap 3 and 4(`react-bootstrap-table@4.0.0` already done) 
* Clean Code and Testing
* Decrease the size of bundled file
* **Split module/functionality from core module, make core module more lightweight**
* Use [`storybook`](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to build examples
* Support the aggregation(summary) view
* Support the table footer
* Support column/row span on header and body
* Support sticky header
* Support table section([react-bootstrap-table#721](https://github.com/AllenFang/react-bootstrap-table/pull/721))
* Handle events well
* Fix unalign issues
* Make **stateless** table more easy to use(`react-bootstrap-table` alread have `remote` mode but have some bugs)
* Customizable table
* Support the nested data([react-bootstrap-table#50](https://github.com/AllenFang/react-bootstrap-table/issues/50â—Š))
* Consider to support column resize
* Consider to make animation on `react-bootstrap-table2` more easy

## The feature may lost on react-bootstrap-table
* Have a great chance that I don't support the vertical scrollbar on table
